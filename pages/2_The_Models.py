Welcome to the synthetic data models library!

In this chapter, you'll explore four foundational models from the [Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)](https://docs.sdv.dev/).

### Basic Single Table Synthesizers

**Synthesizers** are tools that use machine learning algorithms that:
1) Learn the patterns and characteristics from real datasets
3) Create artificial data that maintains the same statistical characteristics and behavior as the original

The **CTGAN Synthesizer** uses a GAN-based approach where a generator and discriminator compete to improve output quality.  

It‚Äôs particularly effective on **imbalanced** and **mixed-type** datasets (e.g., medical or credit data).  

CTGAN can take longer to train but often produces high-fidelity results that preserve deep feature relationships.

>**Best for:** High-stakes, highly structured datasets where accuracy matters most.

The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) offers a range of synthesizers. Each mdoel is designed with own strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases.

### A Quick Guide to Different SDV Synthesizers:
