To run the Lab, you’ll need to install the required tools (like SDV, Pandas, Plotly, and others).
These handle all data processing and synthetic generation.

Without these, nothing else works!

Upload your dataset in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format using the Lab’s interface.

No single engine works best for all data. Training multiple models gives you options for the best synthetic output.
