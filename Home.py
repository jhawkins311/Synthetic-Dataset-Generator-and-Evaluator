### üìö Course Chapters

#### [**Chapter 1: The History**](https://capstone-dz3iduiobkviwaijgqcvqg.streamlit.app/The_History)
Discover how the need for privacy-preservation lead to the creation of synthetic data and why it's essential for modern AI tools

#### [**Chapter 2: The Models**](https://capstone-dz3iduiobkviwaijgqcvqg.streamlit.app/The_Models)
Meet the four core models used to generate synthetic datasets: CTGAN, TVAE, GaussianCopula, and CopulaGAN, 

#### [**Chapter 3: The Process**](https://capstone-dz3iduiobkviwaijgqcvqg.streamlit.app/The_Process)
See a full example of the synthetic data process in action, from uploading a dataset to evaluating the results. 

#### [**Chapter 4: The Lab**](https://capstone-dz3iduiobkviwaijgqcvqg.streamlit.app/The_Lab)
